# Simultaneous-Localization-and-Mapping
Implementing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping Technique to Track the Location of a Robot in a 2D World

# Project Overview
In this project, I implemented SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2-dimensional world. I combined my knowledge of robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment using only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot over time. SLAM provides a way to track the location of a robot in real-time and identify landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features.
